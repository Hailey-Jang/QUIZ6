# Test for Presence of All Cities:
# This test checks whether all the specified cities are present in the dataset. It ensures that none of the cities are missing from the variable "german_cities".

test_that("All specified cities are present in the dataset", {
  expect_true(all(c("Berlin", "Hamburg", "Munich", "Cologne", "Frankfurt", "Rostock") %in% german_cities))
})

# Test for Absence of Extra Cities:
# This test verifies that the variable "german_cities" does not contain any additional cities beyond the specified ones. It ensures that the dataset only contains the cities mentioned.

test_that("No extra cities are present in the dataset", {
  expect_equal(sort(unique(german_cities)), sort(c("Berlin", "Hamburg", "Munich", "Cologne", "Frankfurt", "Rostock")))

# Test for Unique Cities:
# This test confirms that each city appears only once in the dataset, preventing duplicates. It ensures that there are no repeated entries for any city in the "german_cities" variable.
